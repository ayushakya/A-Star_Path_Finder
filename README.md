# A path finder that uses A* algorithm

A simple Data structure and Algorithm project that uses A* algorithm to find the path between two two point in a grid.

This project contains a C implementation of A* with the use of SDL library for graphics. 

You can select any two points between the grid that are not the obstacle and the algorithm tries to find the shortest path between them. The path A* finds may not always be the optimal one.
